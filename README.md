## General Info
***
The project carried out in collaboration with Ericsson involves creating a neural network in Python, using clustering algorithms to identify permitted routes within a port. By utilizing a dataset of latitude and longitude, we are able to create clusters to identify permitted routes. Finally, using test datasets, we verify the accuracy of the network in distinguishing between permitted and non-permitted routes.

## Technologies
***
A list of technologies used within the project:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [GeoPy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
